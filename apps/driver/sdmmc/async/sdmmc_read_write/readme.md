# SDMMC driver asynchronous - SDMMC Read Write

This example application shows how to use the SDMMC driver in asynchronous mode to perform block operations on the SD Card Media.

## Description

- This example uses the SDMMC driver in asynchronous mode in both Bare-Metal to perform Block Erase/Write/Read operations on SD-Card
- This application writes 60KB (61440 bytes) of data starting at the SD Card memory location 0x2000
- It then reads and verifies the written data

## Downloading and building the application

To clone or download this application from Github, go to the [main page of this repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core_apps_sam_9x7) and then click Clone button to clone this repository or download as zip file.
This content can also be downloaded using content manager by following these [instructions](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/contentmanager/wiki).

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/driver/sdmmc/async/sdmmc_read_write/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| sam_9x75_eb.X | MPLABX project for [SAM9X75-EB Evaluation Board]() |
|||

## Setting up AT91Bootstrap loader

To load the application binary onto the target device, we need to use at91bootstrap loader. Refer to the [at91bootstrap loader documentation](../../../../docs/readme_bootstrap.md) for details on how to configure, build and run bootstrap loader project and use it to bootstrap the application binaries.

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_9x75_eb.X | [SAM9X75-EB Evaluation Board]() |
|||

### Setting up [SAM9X75-EB Evaluation Board]()

#### Addtional hardware required

- SD Card with FAT32 file system

#### Setting up the board

- SDMMC slot used is SDMMC0 (J8)
- Connect the DBGU0 J34 on board to the computer using a UART-FTDI cable (to enable debug com port)
- Connect the USB port J28 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)

## Running the Application

1. Build the application using its IDE
2. The LED is turned ON when the read data from the SD Card matches with the written data


Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAM9X75-EB Evaluation Board]()  | RGB_LED(Green) |
