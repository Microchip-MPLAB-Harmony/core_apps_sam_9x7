# FAT filesystem using RAM Media

This application shows an example of using the MPLAB Harmony File System to access RAM media

## Description

Application defines below array for reserving region in RAM for Fat File system based on the Start address and size configured in MHC

```c
#define KEEP  __attribute__((keep, section(".ram_nocache"), address(DRV_MEMORY_DEVICE_START_ADDRESS)))

/* Create an array for reserving region in RAM for Fat File system */
char CACHE_ALIGN RAM_FAT_MEDIA[DRV_MEMORY_DEVICE_MEDIA_SIZE_BYTES] KEEP;
```

### File System Operations on the RAM:

- Performs a SYS_FS_FormatDisk
- Opens a **newfile.txt** on the RAM
- Write and reads back 4KB of data on **newfile.txt**
- Verifies the Data Read back

### File system layer uses the following components

- One instance of the Memory driver is used to communicate with the RAM PLIB

### Setting up [SAM9X75-Curiosity Development Board]()

#### Setting up the board

- Connect the USB port J28 on board to the computer using a micro USB cable (to power the board)

## Running the Application

1. Build and program the application using its IDE
2. The LED is turned ON if data has successfully been written and read back from file "newfile.txt"

Refer to the following table for LED name:

| Board | LED Name |
| ----- | -------- |
|  [SAM9X75-Curiosity Development Board]()  | RGB_LED(Green) |
